# REST API server sample in NodeJs

This is a sample project for learning NodeJs with basic monolithic architecture. 

# Configuration 

For setting up the server rename "sample_default.json" file to "default.json". Add global configuration variables "mongoURI" (Remote database connection), "githubClientId", and "githubClientSecret" (github application variables, found on Dev Settings) with proper values. 

# Initialize server 

```javascript

node index.js

```
